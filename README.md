# One on One meetings

The one-on-one meetings are vital for organizational growth. Many people-managers overlook the benefits of one-on-one meetings. One of the main reasons is, the manager usually ask a set of similar 3–10 questions repeatedly. The repetition of questions makes the meeting boring for both, manager and subordinates.

The Internet has many excellent resources and recommendations for the questions that can be used in one-on-ones. Here is the consolidated list of the sample questions which you can readily use in your conversation.
